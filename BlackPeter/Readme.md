Matching Card Game (Black Peter)

What we need: A deck of cards (regular, colored cards or special symbol cards made especially for the game).The cards are in pairs of two. For example two cards with the same color, or the same symbol. There is only one card that does not have a matching card.
This is either the Queen in regular deck of cards, the black in colored or chimney sweeper card(in special sets).

Rules:

1. One player shuffles the deck and deals the cards, one at a time, untill all the cards have been handed out.
2. Each player removes matching pairs at the beginning.
3. The players take turns and choose from opponent's cards one at a time. 
4. If the card matches any of theirs -he/she removes the pair.

Object of the game:

The goal for each player is to form pairs and discard them. The winner pairs all her/his cards. The looser is left with the black/Queen?Chimney sweeper card.

Unsolved Problems:

1. The word "result" appears at the beginning of the game. I would hide it and let the Winning message come straight after the end of the game.

Future features:

1. The color cards can be replaced with real cards.
2. Restart button.
3. Some sounds anouncing the card dealing and the winner.
