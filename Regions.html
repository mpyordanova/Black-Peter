    <div class="grid-item">Beach Vacation.<br>
        <p>Tropical islands offer the perfect setting for a relaxing getaway that will let you recharge in a beautiful setting with palm trees and colorful sunsets.Going to the beach can improve your body's ability to fight off infections. The iodine in ocean water is a wonderful immune system booster. It is a natural antiseptic and even helps boost the function of your thyroid gland. You will notice a painful sting when an open cut is exposed to salt water, and that is a sign that your wound is being cleansed. Travel to Hawaii, the Caribbean, South Pacific, the Florida Keys, Bahamas and other amazing tropical destinations.</p>

    <div class="grid-item"> Mountain escape.<br>
        <p>While a lot of people prefer going somewhere sunny or to the beach for a little escape, very few actually consider the mountains. The terrain is rough, the weather is all over the place and sometimes, the facilities are not all that exquisite. That being said, the mountains are a place of extreme calm and offer so much more than you can imagine.</p></div>
